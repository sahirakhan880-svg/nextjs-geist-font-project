## Detailed Implementation Plan for Personal Reading Management App

### Overview
The goal is to create a personal reading management app that allows users to store reading lists, track chapters of novels and manhwa, and maintain a wishlist, all while supporting offline access. The app will utilize local storage for data persistence and will be built using the existing Next.js 15+ setup with TypeScript.

### Feature Set
1. **Reading Lists**: Users can create, edit, and delete reading lists for novels and manhwa.
2. **Chapter Tracking**: Users can track chapters read and update their progress.
3. **Wishlist**: Users can add titles to a wishlist for future reading.
4. **Offline Support**: The app will use local storage to save data, allowing access without an internet connection.
5. **User Interface**: A modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

### Step-by-Step Outline of Changes

  - Create a custom hook to manage the state of reading lists, chapters, and wishlist.
  - Use React's `useState` and `useEffect` to handle data fetching and updates.

#### 7. Implement Error Handling
- **File**: Throughout the application
- **Changes**:
  - Add error handling for local storage operations.
  - Display user-friendly error messages in the UI when operations fail.

#### 8. Testing
